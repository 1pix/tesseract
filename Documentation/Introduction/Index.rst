Overview
--------

The Tesseract Project is a suite of extensions that provides a global MVC framework to gather,
filter and output data within TYPO3. It defines several types of objects that can interact
with one another using a controller and that exchange data between themselves using
standardized data formats. This standardization of interfaces and data exchange formats
makes it possible to build a very flexible architecture.

The base use of this framework is to be able to query any table in the local TYPO3 database,
filter and sort the retrieved records and display them in the FE. However the flexibility
of the architecture makes it open to many other uses.

Additional information and fresh news about the project can be found on the dedicated
web site: http://www.typo3-tesseract.com/.

What is a tesseract?
--------------------

A tesseract is a 4-dimensional cube. The project was named after this structure
because it symbolizes the various views that can be produced from a single set of data.
